</a>

Hello everyone, I've recently started practicing **SEO** on my own website. Before, I had a few random posts, mainly written blindly without any keywords or proper descriptions rofl. Lately, I've been lurking and realized the need to do some **website audit work**, so I tried it on my page. Since keyword auditing is quite manual, I attempted to create a tool to minimize errors and speed up the process ⚡. I'm writing this repo to introduce it to those who have similar **auditing needs** and also to seek opinions for improvement.
