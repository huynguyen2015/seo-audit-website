Hello everyone, I've recently started practicing **SEO** on my own website. Before, I had a few random posts, mainly written blindly without any keywords or proper descriptions rofl. Lately, I've been lurking and realized the need to do some **website audit work**, so I tried it on my page. Since keyword auditing is quite manual, I attempted to create a tool to minimize errors and speed up the process âš¡. I'm writing this post to introduce it to those who have similar **auditing needs** and also to seek opinions for improvement.

## Analyze Website's keyword Features

The main function of the tool is to **list the keywords** on the page and **find focused keywords**. It'll giving you a list and 2 chart for visualize purpose

## You can try it by following these steps:

Step 1: Visit [**https://www.1hour.dev/tools**](https://www.1hour.dev/tools)

Step 2: Select '**Analyze website's keyword**'.

Step 3: Enter your sitemap URL and choose '**analyze**'

Bellow is an example i did with my website
